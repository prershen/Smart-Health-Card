# Smart-Health-Card

This project uses VB.net forms, MySQL database and arduino ide to control NodeMCU which is connected to an RFID reader. Each smart card has an RFID tag and the forms have included same forms for 2 people - Ramesh and Suresh. The forms let you add and view the medical history of that respective person. NodeMCU sends an sms to a number mentioned in the IFTTT applet through webhooks. This has been basically on local host.
